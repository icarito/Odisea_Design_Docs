# OdysseyScript (OYS): Input and Testing DSL Specification

## Overview

OdysseyScript is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed to write deterministic player input sequences within the Odisea engine. It solves the issue of fragile binary replays by allowing developers to define intent (e.g., "walk for 5 seconds") instead of raw binary input buffers.

## Structural Elements

### Sections (`SECTION ... END`)

Sections group logical commands and define a success or failure context.

- Isolation: identifies exactly which part of a test failed.
- Asserts: validate state upon completion of each section.
- Reporting: the test engine logs `SECTION PASSED` or `SECTION FAILED`.

### Sequentiality and Blocking

By default, commands are blocking. A line does not execute until the previous one completes its duration or reaches its goal.

### The `AT` Modifier (Parallelism)

The `AT` modifier allows triggering an action while a movement command is still active.

- Syntax: `[COMMAND] [VALUE] AT [TIME/DIST] [ACTION]`
- Example: `FW 5 AT 2 JUMP` (move forward 5 units, but at second 2, press jump).

## Command Vocabulary

| Command | Arguments | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SET` | `prop val` | `SET pos (0,0,0)` | Forces player state (teleport). |
| `FW / BW` | `value` | `FW 5.0` | Move forward/backward for X seconds or meters. |
| `LT / RT` | `degrees` | `LT 90` | Rotate camera left/right. |
| `JUMP` | `[time]` | `JUMP 0.5` | Jump. Optionally holds the button down. |
| `WAIT` | `time` | `WAIT 1.0` | Character remains still (idle input). |
| `LOOK` | `pitch` | `LOOK -45` | Sets the vertical camera angle. |
| `INTERACT` | `-` | `INTERACT` | Presses the interaction key (`E`). |
| `ASSERT` | `cond [msg]` | `ASSERT pos.y > 2` | Verifies a physics or state condition. |

## Script Example: Backflip and Precision Test

```oys
// Initial Setup
SET pos (0, 0, 0)
SET rot 0

SECTION "Backflip Validation"
    FW 4.0                 // Walk 4 seconds forward
    LOOK -20               // Look slightly down
    WAIT 0.5               // Small pause
    BW 2.0 AT 0.1 JUMP 0.3 // Start retreating and jump almost simultaneously
    LT 180                 // Turn 180 degrees upon landing
    ASSERT pos.z < -1.0    // Verify the backflip moved us backward
END

SECTION "Object Interaction"
    FW 2.0 AT 1.5 INTERACT // Walk toward an object and interact halfway
    ASSERT door_open == true "The door did not open"
END
```
